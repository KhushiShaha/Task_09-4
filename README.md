Crime Type Analysis – Syracuse Open Data

In this phase of the Syracuse Civic Data project, we focused on identifying the most frequently occurring types of crimes based on the 2023 crime dataset. This submission presents:

- A script to analyze and visualize the top 10 most reported crime types.
- Summary insights on common offenses.
- A chart to communicate the findings visually.

This analysis sets the stage for further exploration by time and geography.
